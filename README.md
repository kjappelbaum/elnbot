# elnbot

Me playing around with a telegram bot to conveniently add data to the ELN and also query some chemistry information.
A fun application would be to couple it also with some online analysis (e.g. image recognition) or integrate it with lab automation.

## How to run it

For simple testing without upload on EPFL internal serves, one can host it on glitch. If the upload to the samba share for images is needed, it is important to have the corresponding share mounted in the filesystem.
